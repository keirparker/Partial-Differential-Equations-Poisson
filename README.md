.1. Initial value problems: the Cahn-Hilliard equationThe Cahn-Hilliard equation describes phase separation in a physical systemsuch as a water-and-oil emulsion.  The equation is written in terms of a compo-sitional order parameter,φ(x,t), which depends on positionxand time t which is,  for  instance,  positive  if  locally  there  is  more  water  than  oil,  and  negativeotherwise.

2. 3.2 Boundary value problems: Poisson’s equation The electrostatic potential φ(r) due to a (scalar) field of electric chargesρ(r)is the solution of Poissons equation ∇^2φ=−ρ/E0,(5)where E0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, and where one should imagine appropriate  boundary  conditions  are  imposed.   The  electric  field  is  obtainedfrom the potential via E=−∇φ.
